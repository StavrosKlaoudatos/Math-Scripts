Python Scripts for Mathematical computations


In this repository, you will find some files that are you can use to compute mathematical equations! You can use each script y itself, or you can use the main calculator script to use all files in a single run, but that requires you to download all the .py scripts, and have them stored in the same folder with the the main calculator script!
